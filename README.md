# Rinex_data_extractor
This file extracts the data of Rinex file i.e., Pseudoranges, SNR/Signal, Doppler etc. and saves in a simplified CSV format

Currently the code is written in python3 for Rinex 2.10

DEPENDENCIES-
python3.8
numpy==1.18.5
pandas==1.1.2
tkinter==8.6

I would certainly like to write code for different versions of rinex file but I don't have data files and its format information.

If you can provide data file and rinex format information of that perticular verion I will make the data extractor code for you.

NOTE:- This was an interesting project requested by someone. I am willing make imporvement to this code according your comments and feedback. Furthermore, If you have these kind of interesting projects please let me know, I will code for ya. A little remunarations will be required if the project is big.
